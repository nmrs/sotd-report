Warmer here in the morning, so I started the shave on my back patio. Beautiful morning, perfectly sunny, with a high of 74°, according to the local weatherman.

Devil's PATH is my absolute favorite Black Ship soap, and my all-time favorite scent. I picked up the full set at Maggard's, but have a smush of this soap and the matching AS that I've had since the day I purchased them. Both have a generous amount of scent, but the soap seems to last a little longer. Lather was great this morning. As I said, the soap is sturdy, and holds a great lather, regardless of the load. I much prefer this base to my 2016 Groomatorium's base.

Great shave again for day two. Oh, and the weatherman was wrong about the high. It wasn't as high, it was 69° as I was shaving.

**Challenge:** I bought this shirt, and this razor, for the lather games. I haven't worn either of them yet and I don't expect to until after the games are over, but if and when the games last longer than two weeks, I'll wear them.

**Statistics:** I went on a massive binge of ASH, and purchased four of them. My current tally is __18 Soaps__ 10 Soap, 3 AS, and __5 Aftershaves__ 4 Soap, 1 AS. I also added a few more razors and brushes, including a Wolfman, a few more brushes, and a few different tubs. I'm still ~$350 shy of $1000 and I still have time to pull it off.

Edit: no words can accurately describe how much I fucking love this community. This subreddit is everything to me. I said to myself on the first day, after about three or four days in the sub, "I can't stop now. This is it, I am here now." My mind always drifts to this sub, no matter where I am.  I'm here for this subreddit and for this group of listers. I'd have to buckle down a bit and try to find something productive to do, to not just frivolously flirt with my time in this sub like I always have. I know I'm good at flirting and being a bit frivolous, but I might actually find more fulfillment in adding a little structure.
