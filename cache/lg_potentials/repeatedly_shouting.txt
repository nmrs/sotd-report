The only bummer is that the soap hasn’t been a go to for me lately but recently u/BuffZombie has been putting it on the map.  The aftershave is my go-to soap and I actually love the scent. Seville is one of my absolute favorite men’s scents though constantly getting shoved aside by the others but there’s something about it that I never tire of.  The fragrance opened very nicely and is money.  At the end of the day it’s still a citrus scent with a bit of musk but it’s pretty damn good.

Today was significantly less miserable for me and I’m still just waiting for today to be over.  I was on the fence about using the Excalibur but when my face shut down I went and put it to use and it did amazing.

I’ll cut it short and just give a shout out to my parents and my sister. They’re the ones that have had to watch so much of this. They are always just there for me and I’m pretty sure they would miss me if they weren’t still around. I’m lucky to have them in my life.

And to my cats. My little rescue of a feral (I had it neutered and on a diet. ) who is always up for snuggle time. Omar is a crazy ball of energy and really is my dog. I can’t get enough of him, he’s loyal and his face is just tooooo cute.

Sorry for the late
