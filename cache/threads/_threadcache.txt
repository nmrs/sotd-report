Cache folder for the SOTD threads. 

A handful of threads refuse to come back from Reddit's search for whatever reason,
so those need to be manually added to the manual.json file in this folder to ensure
they are processed if we force refresh the cache (if you do force refresh the cache/delete the
cache files, make sure to keep the manual.json file)

The format of manual entries is:

    {
        "date": "2023-02-10",
        "id": "10yirpy",
        "title": "Friday SOTD Thread - Feb 10, 2023",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/10yirpy/friday_sotd_thread_feb_10_2023/"
    }

(Only date and id are actually processed, but the title and url field are useful for remembering
what you added. Date alone is not sufficient as it doesn't capture whether this is a standard or
special event, e.g. Lather Games, SOTD thread)
