* **Brush:** Zenith B-28  
* **Razor:** Muhle R41  
* **Blade:** Polsilver  
* **Lather:** Barbasol Original
* **Post Shave:** [Pinaud - Clubman - Aftershave](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/1445/?product_type=aftershave)
* **Fragrance:** Breze - Black + Gold  

Working from home today so I lucked out on today's drop. This was the second shave I participated in Lather Games and it was preceded by the Mondoid podcast shave. My first Father's Day so I had to remember Barbasol from back in the day. It started appearing in stores in the early 90's and I think this tube is from the early 90's. Aerosol used to be a big thing where I grew up. I've had bad experiences with it but this may be an exception as I haven't had any unpleasantness when using stuff like this.  The splash is weak but tolerable and the aftershave feels a bit more potent so it was highly successful olfactory wise. It's a bit too strong to use everyday sadly. The R41 is really nice. The bar to pull hairs on the go is so much better then my Shick Tech. Not too bad of a shave today though. I got a BBS smooth and not to close. I'd say on target.

# Objective for today

Two for two for today

 achieving two unique shaves

unique soaps and splashes

# challenge

My dad isn’t too involved in my life with work commitments so that makes the Lather Games non-competitive by default. However, my second year of competition is the first year I brought home ROTY

# hardware vendors

Full Point - No Hardware Vendors

# Subject Specific hardware vendors

Brush - Zenith B28 great manhandle and knot

Razor - Muhle R41 the perfect mild razor for startup shavers

Lather - Soap of the boys Barboss cream yesterday, today’s old boomer soap

Post - Clubman as I mentioned, might be intended as an old boomer scent....or just a broad smell edgier than most

Frag - Breze Black and Gold pleasant scent but no real fragrance notes
