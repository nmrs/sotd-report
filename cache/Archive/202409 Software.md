Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for September 2024

* 1,575 shave reports from 114 distinct shavers during the month of September 2024 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 559 distinct soaps from 126 distinct brands.

## Observations

* u/OnionMiasma's [Third Annual Shave Against Suicide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1e1t7n8/pif_thirdannual_shave_against_suicide_samples/) on [September 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fevkpm/theme_thursday_sotd_thread_sep_12_2024/) pushed House of Mammoth's Kryptonite to the top of the charts this month. It's great to see both this (and that [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1feuogc/3rd_annual_shave_against_suicide_sotd_post/) community show up to suppport such an important cause.

* Barrister and Mann has offered up a bordering-on-absurd number of fougeres over the years and five of them got lathered up this month: [Fougère Aromatique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fqh0xr/comment/lp77zkm/), [Fougère Angelique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fa83uu/comment/lltmrnf/), [Fougère Classique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1f7sora/comment/lleqshm/), [Fougère Gothique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1ffnq48/comment/lmy9ff5/), and [Fougère Imperiale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fl57u9/comment/lo2az59/). u/BostonPhotoTourist - is that a full sweep or are there still more out there? Also, I bet Fougère Imperiale feels left out of the [cool ques club](https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--CtSXCKp2--/c_crop,x_10,y_10/c_fit,h_675/c_crop,g_north_west,h_1038,w_1038,x_-242,y_-182/l_upload:v1565806151:production:blanks:vdbwo35fw6qtflw9kezw/fl_layer_apply,g_north_west,x_-353,y_-293/b_rgb:000000/c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1615013737/production/designs/19978963_0.jpg).

  * edit: If we include [Passiflora](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fevkpm/comment/lms66qi/), [Beaudelaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1f8m2d0/comment/llhgpl3/), and [Fern](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1fbqyr0/comment/lm3l6u3/), that brings the B&M fougere count up to 8 and we still appear to have full coverage this month. (hat tip to u/ItchyPooter for filling out the list)

* Tabac is ascendent once again, climbing 20 spots on the Soaps list to settle in 2nd this month and remind all the artisans that the traditional brands (aka Big Soap) will [not go gentle into that good night](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night).

* u/scribe__ decided Austere August wasn't enough and went all [Spartan September](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1f67jnp/comment/lkyp4ou/) to single-handedly place Black Ship Grooming - Barnacle Bob in 3rd on the Soaps list.

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
