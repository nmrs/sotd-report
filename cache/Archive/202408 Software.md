Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for August 2024

* 2,533 shave reports from 132 distinct shavers during the month of August 2024 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 238 distinct soaps from 75 distinct brands.

## Observations

* With [768 shaves](https://www.djudge.me/22/view) shaves from [$MammothMafia24](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1dv6576/mammoth_mafia_recruiting_call_officially/) participants (plus another 93 shaves from non-participants), it's no surprise at all that House of Mammoth landed at the top of the chart this month, though I'll admit that I was a little surpised to see that they had over double the shaves of the next nearest soaper, Stirling, especially seeing as Stirling had an [AA challenge of their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1egmjc4/shepherds_of_stirling_challenge_austere_august/), albeit a pretty relaxed one.

* Chiseled Face was only able to attract [nine participants](https://www.djudge.me/23/view) that may or may not love their partners to shave with [Midnight Stag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/1dxvo6z/hark_the_substantialstag_side_challenge_is_here/) all month, but that was still enough for them to leapfrog Barrister and Mann to claim third in the Soap Maker contest. And since $SubstantialStag was focused on a single scent (unlike $MammothMafia24 and $ShepherdsofStirling), Midnight Stag easily claimed the top spot in the Soaps race.

* Without a contest of their own to help juice their numbers, Barrister and Mann failed to claim the top spot for the first time since I've been doing this report.

* Given the choice of smelling like a [pine tree](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/all/products/scots-pine-sheep-shave-soap), a [mosquito repellant candle](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/all/products/electric-sheep-shave-soap), [nothing](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/collections/all/products/sheep-shave-soap), or [wonderful](https://maggardrazors.com/products/stirling-soap-co-varen-shaving-soap-5-8oz), the Shepherds chose wisely and pushed Varen up to third in the Soaps list. (Yes, [lemongrassy vetiver](https://maggardrazors.com/products/stirling-soap-co-port-au-prince-shaving-soap-5-8oz-seasonal-release) was also a choice, but that description didn't rank high enough on the snarkmeter to earn it a call out.)

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
