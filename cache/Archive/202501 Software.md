Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for January 2025

* 1,540 shave reports from 115 distinct shavers during the month of January 2025 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 594 distinct soaps from 141 distinct brands.

## Observations

* Kudos to Catie's Bubbles for upsetting Stirling and sneaking into second in the Brand Diversity contest.

* The Soap Makers contest isn't too surprising with the usual suspects in reasonably expected positions.

* The Soaps table on the other hand looks like someone put all the choices in a lottery ball picker and popped them out randomly. Tabac and Hygge aren't terribly surprising to see up there, but where did Haverford and Ghost Town Barber come from? Haverford only had 73 shaves in all of 2024, so seeing 30 shaves in January was a surprise, albeit a pleasant one (someone needed to knock Tabac off the top step). And Ghost Town Barber hasn't had more than 11 shaves in a month since I've been doing this report, so doubling that plus some was quite an accomplishment. I went back to look at all the January Theme Thursdays to see if one was a Barbershop theme since Hyggen and GTB ranked so highly, but nope, that wasn't it. And that still wouldn't explain Haverford's dominance, so who knows.

* Also, Williams Mug Soap in #8? I'm not gonna try and explain it. I just report the [gnews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAwVIZDAUF0).

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
