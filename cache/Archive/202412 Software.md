Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for December 2024

* 1,578 shave reports from 113 distinct shavers during the month of December 2024 were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used 540 distinct soaps from 139 distinct brands.

## Observations

* Christmas-themed scents unsurprisingly dominate the top of the scent table this December. HoM's Santa Noir just edges past Stirling's Christmas Eve to grab the trophy for favorite Christmas scent of 2025 and most popular scent of December overall, while Barrister and Mann's Vesper's sneaks past Tabac to compete the Christmas-themed sweep of the medal places. Noble Otter 'Tis the Season is 6th overall but picks up the fourth-place participation trophy in the holiday scent category. 

* Barrister and Mann's scent diversity strength is on display again this month. They win the overall diversity contest and take 3rd, 5th and 6th place in the holiday scent contest with Vespers, Dickens Revisted, and Noggin' On Heaven's Door. Combined they rack up 62 shaves, easily making B&M the most popular holiday-themed soap maker. Curiosly, B&M's Hallows, a Halloween-themed scent, outperforms two of their Christmas scents.

* I find it intereresting how close the average shaves per user is at the top of the chart in both the Soap Maker and Scent tables where the top two contests are off by just .04 and .08 shaves per user respectively.

* If we exlude individual shavers who pump up their favorite soap/maker Abbate Y La Mantia dominates the Average Shavers per User contest with 11.33 shaves across 3 users (though that was still largely the result of a single shaver with u/scribe__ using Crumiro 30 times in December).

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the month.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the month from that particular brand.

* The change Δ vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that month. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that month. n/a means the item was not present in that month.
