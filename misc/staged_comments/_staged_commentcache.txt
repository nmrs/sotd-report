My dad passed last October. On a day like today, he was dragging me outside the house to the garden in our backyard so we can find the big, juicy worms to go fishing during the  following weekend. Eufros' Tierra Humeda reminds me of all this. I overloaded the brush a little (way) too much, but wanted the smell to linger for a while. He would have been 70 today (and my mother-in-law is turning 65!). Papa -- you are missed. Happy Birthday.",
