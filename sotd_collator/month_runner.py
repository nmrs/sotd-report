Welcome to your SOTD Hardware Report for {target_label}

## Observations

* A fairly nondescript month


## Notes & Caveats

* {len(comments_target)} shave reports from {target_label} were analyzed to produce this report.

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* Blade Format stats don't differentiate between DE and half DE razors, they are all counted as being DE blades

* Blades recorded as just 'GEM' will be matched to 'Personna GEM PTFE' per guidance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/19a43q7/comment/kil95r8/)

* Any brush with a DG knot will come under the DG Bx category - eg Dogwood B8 is recorded as 'DG B8'

* In the case of most brush makers (eg Maggard) - knots are split into synthetic / badger / boar and attributed to the maker - eg 'Maggard Synthetic'

* Notable exceptions to this are Omega and Semogue, in order to retain the model number. Unless someone just puts 'Omega Boar' which I then report as 'Omega (model not specified) Boar' .

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given razor / brush etc in the month. We can combine this with the total number of shaves to get the average number of times a user used a razor / brush etc

* The change Î” vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since the previous month or year. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to the previous month or year. n/a means the item was not present in the previous month / year.
