**August 31, 2024 \u2013 AA Mammoth Month**

\u2022\t\u2060**Brush**: r/wetshaving Zentih MOAR BOAR 31mm  
\u2022\t\u2060**Razor**: Blackland SS Osprey  
\u2022\t\u2060**Blade**: Personna Lab Blue (33)  
\u2022\t\u2060**Lather**: House of Mammoth \u2013 Sonder  
\u2022\t\u2060**Post Shave**: House of Mammoth \u2013 Sonder  
\u2022\t\u2060**Fragrance**: DR Harris \u2013 St James\u2019s 1684

[Ending point of the tubs](https://imgur.com/a/MFn08IB). Used 21g of soap for an average of ~.68 per shave, up from my midpoint and an increase of about .3 relative to beginning of month and last years AA. Balm used 9 grams so about .29g for the month, slightly down from the .35 in the first half. What a cool razor. I tweaked the setting a couple times in the monthly but am thinking 3-7 range is optimal for me. Haven\u2019t taken the brass insert out at all to see how that affects it. 3 piece adjustable is for sure unique.
