Welcome to your SOTD Lather Log for {target_label}

* {shave_reports} shave reports from {len(shavers.keys())} distinct shavers during the month of {target_label} were analyzed to produce this report. Collectively, these shavers used {len(scent_usage.index)} distinct soaps from {len(brand_usage.index)} distinct brands.

## Observations

* Somthing insightful

## Notes & Caveats

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given brand/soap/etc in the {TIME_PERIOD}.

* The Brand Diversity table details the number of distinct soaps used during the {TIME_PERIOD} from that particular brand.

* The change Î” vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that {TIME_PERIOD}. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that {TIME_PERIOD}. n/a means the item was not present in that {TIME_PERIOD}.
