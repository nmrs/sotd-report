The only comparable Badger I've used was a much pricier Kent I traded away because it wasn't worth the coin. This is much nicer - soft,  dense, and lathers wonderfully. I've another small Badger on the way,  looking forward to seeing how they compare.  \n\nWish I could say the whole shave was great. Sadly,  these Personna blades seem to fall into the growing crowd of popular blades that don't agree with me. Lots of post shave irritation. ",
