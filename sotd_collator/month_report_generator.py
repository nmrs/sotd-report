Welcome to your SOTD Hardware Report for {target_label}

## Observations

* A fairly nondescript {TIME_PERIOD}


## Notes & Caveats

* {shave_reports} shave reports from {len(shavers.keys())} distinct shavers during the month of {target_label} were analyzed to produce this report.

* I only show the top n results per category to keep the tables readable and avoid max post length issues.

* Blade Format stats now differentiate between DE and half DE razors.

* "Other" in the Blade Format table includes vintage reusable blades (including Rolls, Valet Auto Strop, and old-style lather catchers with wedge blades) as well as other antique proprietary blade formats (e.g. Enders Speed Blade)

* Blades recorded as just 'GEM' will be matched to 'Personna GEM PTFE' per guidance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/19a43q7/comment/kil95r8/)

* The Personna blade name is [going away](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/what-do-you-know-about-this-personna-no-longer-exists.647703/&ved=2ahUKEwiyi4n7pPKFAxXeLtAFHfNVDz8QFnoECAQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw38QYgjzknuIIIV94b6VDP5), but the majority of entries are still coming in under Personna, so I am sticking to that for this report. Once more than 50% of the entries come in under the new names, I will reverse this and map any old Personna entries to the new name.

    * Personna GEM PTFE is now Accutec Pro Premium (GEM)
  
    * Personna Lab Blue is now Accuforge Super Stainless MicroCoat
  
    * Personna Med Prep is now Accuthrive Super Med Prep

* In the case of most brush makers (eg Maggard) - knots are split into synthetic / badger / boar and attributed to the maker - eg 'Maggard Synthetic', though for particularly popular brush models (e.g. specific models from Semogue and Omega) or knots (e.g. DG, Chisel & Hound, or AP Shave Co.) they are reported on indvidually.

* The unique user column shows the number of different users who used a given razor / brush etc in the month. We can combine this with the total number of shaves to get the average number of times a user used a razor / brush etc

* The change Î” vs columns show how an item has moved up or down the rankings since that {TIME_PERIOD}. = means no change in position, up or down arrows indicate how many positions up or down the rankings an item has moved compared to that {TIME_PERIOD}. n/a means the item was not present in that {TIME_PERIOD}.
